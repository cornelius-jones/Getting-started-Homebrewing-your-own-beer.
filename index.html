    <ul>
      <li><b>Boil Pot</b> - The entire boiling process, including extract, hops and/or other ingredients, takes place in the boil pot, or kettle. <i>2.5 gallon is recommended.</i></li> 
      <li><b>Hydrometer</b> - A hydrometer is used to measure the gravity, or sugar density in wort and beer. </li>
      <li><b>Bung and Airlock</b> - An airlock is inserted in the top of a fermenter and allows carbon dioxide, to escape the fermenter without letting contaminants in.</li>
      <li><b>Carboy</b> - Carboys are glass jugs, much like water cooler bottles, that brewers use for making beer, wine, hard cider & mead.</li>
      <li><b>Funnel (optional)</b></li>
      <li><b>Fermenter</b> - A vessel is needed to hold the wort as it ferments into beer.</li>
      <li><b>Heat Source</b> - The stove in your kitchen should suffice for smaller amounts, while a turkey fryer or another powerful heat source works well for larger batches.</li>
      <li><b>Stir Spoon</b> - During the boil, stirring is required for a variety of reasons. Plastic, wooden, and stainless steel spoons are commonly used.</li>
      <li><b>Thermometer</b> - Be sure to acquire a calibrated thermometer that can withstand high temperatures.</li>

      <li><b>Beer</b> - Any beverage made by fermenting a wort made from malted barley and seasoned with hops.</li> 
      <li><b>Hops</b> - Hop vines are grown in cool climates and brewers make use of the cone-like flowers. The dried cones are available in pellets, plugs, or whole.</li>
      <li><b>Boil</b> - The stove in your kitchen should suffice for smaller amounts, while a turkey fryer or another powerful heat source works well for larger batches.</li>
      <li><b>Sanitize</b> - To reduce microbial contaminants to insignificant levels.</li>
      <li><b>Wort</b> - The malt-sugar solution that is boiled prior to fermentation.</li> 
      <li><b>Malt</b> - The principal source for fermentable sugar in beer.</li>
      <li><b>Trub</b> - A layer of sediment forms at the bottom of the fermentation vessel. This sediment comprises all the unfermentable products in wort such as fats, proteins, hops, and dead yeast.</li>
      <li><b>Mash</b> - The hot water steeping process which hydrates the barley, activates the malt enzymes, and converts the grain starches into fermentable sugars.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="left_mobile">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Hydrometer</b> - A hydrometer is used to measure the gravity, or sugar density in wort and beer. </li>
      <li><b>Bung and Airlock</b> - An airlock is inserted in the top of a fermenter and allows carbon dioxide, to escape the fermenter without letting contaminants in.</li>
      <li><b>Carboy</b> - Carboys are glass jugs, much like water cooler bottles, that brewers use for making beer, wine, hard cider & mead.</li>
      <li><b>Funnel (optional)</b></li>
      <li><b>Fermenter</b> - A vessel is needed to hold the wort as it ferments into beer.</li>
      <li><b>Heat Source</b> - The stove in your kitchen should suffice for smaller amounts, while a turkey fryer or another powerful heat source works well for larger batches.</li>
      <li><b>Stir Spoon</b> - During the boil, stirring is required for a variety of reasons. Plastic, wooden, and stainless steel spoons are commonly used.</li>
      <li><b>Mash</b> - The hot water steeping process which hydrates the barley, activates the malt enzymes, and converts the grain starches into fermentable sugars.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class= "sect2_right">
      <ul>
      <li><b>Pitching</b> - Adding the yeast into the chilled wort.</li>
      <li><b>Liquid Malt Extract (LME)</b> - Concentrated sugar extracted from malted barley in a liquid, syrup form.</li>
      <li><b>Dried Malt Extract (DME)</b> - Concentrated sugar extracted from malted barley in powder form</li>
      <li><b>IBU (International Bitterness Units)</b> - a chemical measurement of the number of bittering compounds, specifically isomerized and oxidized alpha acids, polyphenols, and a few other select bittering chemicals, that make your beer taste bitter. </li>
      <li><b>Fermenting</b> - The total conversion of malt sugars to beer. A vessel is needed to hold the wort as it ferments into beer.</li>
      <li><b>Brew Day</b> - When all the fun happens. The day that the primary beer-making process takes place.</li>
      <li><b>Original Gravity</b> - The original gravity is the specific gravity measured before fermentation.</li>
      <li><b>Final Gravity</b> - The final gravity is the specific gravity measured at the completion of fermentation. </li>
    </ul>
